## Gulp-based Asset Pipeline for Ryan's Agency Theme

> NOTE: This is part of a local build system I use and is not something I am going to actively support as part of this theme. **YMMV**.

1. From within this directory, run `npm install`
2. `gulp`
3. Asset pipeline concatenates and minifies JavaScript files, runs SASS preprocessing, and also includes some basic image resizing via `gulp images`.
