# Ryan's Agency

This is a port of an internal-network-only website I made for my company's Digital Team.

> The use case with respect to content types, models, etc is somewhat specific to our needs. Make sure to pay special attention to the archetypes and required fields. The complexity of the content types is also the reason I created the [site markdown editor][]. Keep this in mind. YMMV.

## Here are just a *few* of the theme features:

* Client-side search with lunr.js (see notes below on how to create your index)
* Shortcodes
  * Audio
  * Video
  * Data visualizations
  * Callouts/admonishments (for docs)
  * Improved code blocks (with "Copy" button)
* [Markdown editor](https://ryans-agency-hugo-theme.netlify.com/editor)
* Optional off-canvas Google Form (eg, Contact Form)
* Team listing with deep linking
* A whole slew of SEO optimizations in the templating

## Configuration

The following is full `config.toml` example for the Ryan's Agency theme:

```
archetypedir = "archetypes"
baseurl = "your-base-url.com"
buildDrafts = false
buildFuture = false
canonifyurls = true

copyright = "Your Company or Name"
# Set to true is you don't want livereload in local development
disableLiveReload= false
# Set to false if you want rss xml files auto-generated
disableRSS = false

## Content Types

* Documentation
* Team Member
* Blog Post
* Single Page

Part of the templating includes `site-index.json`, which is used for live, client-side search in combination with [lunr.js][].

## Full Documentation

Full documentation for the theme can be found at <https://ryans-agency-hugo-theme.netlify.com/theme-docs/>.

Downloading this theme will also include the `theme-docs` folder, which you can copy into `content/` and modify as needed if you would like to include documentation for content creators, editors, etc. This might be a nice feature for easier reference and to document additional features you create during your site development.

## Adding the Search Index

The templating for the search index is already included in the theme. To add the index, create a new markdown document at `content/singles/site-index.md` with the following front matter at the top of the document.

```
---
title: Site Index dummy page
subtitle:
date: 2016-10-01
publishdate: 2016-10-01
type: json
url: /assets/site-index.json
---
```

This will create `/assets/site-index.json`.
